# README for Models

This directory contains the models and prompt templates used in the project for extracting structured tasks from unstructured bilingual natural language input.

## Models

The models are designed to process input in both Romanian and English, utilizing lightweight NLP techniques to identify tasks, times, categories, and deadlines.

### Prompt Templates

The `prompts` directory includes prompt templates that guide the NLP models in extracting structured information from user input. These templates are crucial for ensuring accurate parsing of tasks.

## Usage

To utilize the models and prompts, integrate them with the backend processing pipeline, ensuring that the input is properly formatted and passed to the NLP extractor.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore additional models for improved accuracy.
- Fine-tune existing models with domain-specific data.
- Expand prompt templates to cover more complex task structures.

For more details on specific models and their implementations, refer to the respective files in this directory.
