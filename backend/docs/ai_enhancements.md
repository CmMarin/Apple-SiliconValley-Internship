# AI Enhancement Summary

## 1. Introduction

This document explains the AI enhancements made to the task extraction system. These enhancements address several key user requirements:

1. Better greeting recognition
2. Improved intent recognition 
3. Enhanced date handling with automatic normalization
4. Better task categorization

## 2. Key Improvements

### 2.1 Greeting Recognition

We've implemented a sophisticated greeting detection system that can:

- Recognize simple greetings like "Hello", "Hi", etc.
- Detect complex greeting patterns with additional phrases like "How are you?"
- Support multi-language greetings (both English and Romanian)
- Differentiate between pure greetings and greetings followed by actual tasks

When a pure greeting is detected, the system now returns an empty task list rather than trying to extract non-existent tasks.

### 2.2 Date Normalization

The system now properly handles relative dates by converting them to absolute dates:

- "tomorrow" → Current date + 1 day (e.g., "2025-09-20")
- "today" / "azi" → Current date (e.g., "2025-09-19")
- Days of week ("Friday", "vineri") → Next occurrence of that day
- "next" + time unit (week, month, day name) → Properly calculated future date

This ensures that when tasks mention relative dates like "tomorrow," they get the correct actual date rather than just storing the word "tomorrow."

### 2.3 Improved Task Categorization

Task categorization has been enhanced with:

- More comprehensive keyword lists for both English and Romanian
- Better category mapping with expanded synonyms
- Smarter category detection based on context

### 2.4 Enhanced AI Prompt

The AI service now uses an improved prompt that explicitly instructs the model to:

- Ignore greetings and filler text
- Handle date normalization more effectively
- Extract tasks more accurately from mixed greeting/task inputs

## 3. Code Structure

The following files have been updated:

- `app/nlp/extractor.py`: Added greeting detection and date normalization
- `app/nlp/ai_service.py`: Updated to use the enhanced extractor features

New test files have been created:
- `test_enhanced_service.py`: Tests the enhanced extractor directly
- `test_enhanced_ai.py`: More comprehensive test for the full AI pipeline

## 4. Usage Examples

### 4.1 Greeting Detection

```python
from app.nlp.extractor import is_greeting

# Returns True (pure greeting)
is_greeting("Hello there")  

# Returns False (contains task)
is_greeting("Hello! I need to buy milk tomorrow")
```

### 4.2 Date Normalization

```python
from app.nlp.extractor import normalize_date
from datetime import datetime

today = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")  # e.g., "2025-09-19"

# Returns tomorrow's date: "2025-09-20"
normalize_date("tomorrow")  

# Returns date of next Friday: "2025-09-26"
normalize_date("friday")    
```

### 4.3 Task Extraction

```python
from app.nlp.extractor import extract_tasks

# Returns empty list (just a greeting)
extract_tasks("Hello there")  

# Returns task with normalized date:
# [{"task": "buy milk", "category": "Shopping", "time": None, "deadline": "2025-09-20"}]
extract_tasks("I need to buy milk tomorrow")
```

## 5. Testing

The enhancements have been tested with various inputs including:

- Pure greetings in both English and Romanian
- Mixed inputs with greetings and tasks
- Various date references (tomorrow, specific days, relative dates)
- Different task categories and contexts

The test results confirm that the system now correctly identifies greetings, normalizes dates, and properly categorizes tasks.

## 6. Future Work

Potential future improvements could include:

- Support for more languages
- More sophisticated time normalization (similar to date normalization)
- Enhanced context recognition for better task extraction
- Integration with user preferences for personalized categorization
